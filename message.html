    <h1>For You 💌</h1>
    <p id="typewriter">
      <p>
From the very first moment I met you, something in my heart knew that you were special. 
Every smile of yours makes my day brighter, every conversation feels like magic, 
and every little moment with you is something I want to keep forever. ❤️  
Life has never felt so beautiful until you came into it, and now I can’t imagine a future without you by my side.  
So today, with all my heart, I want to ask you — will you make me the happiest person alive by being mine?  
Not just for today, not just for tomorrow, but for every moment that life blesses us with. 💕  
Will you go on this journey of love with me and let us write the most beautiful story together? Will you be mine?🌹✨
